# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [2.130.1](https://github.com/open-horizon/exchange-api/pull/791) - 2025-07-03
- Moved environment variables for individual logger levels to the logback config xml file.

## [2.130.0](https://github.com/open-horizon/exchange-api/pull/790) - 2025-07-02
- Issue 769: Added basic OAuth capabilities using bearer access tokens and requests to external provided
             userinfo endpoints. A custom header with configuration has been added to supply the intended organization
             to be used for the authenticated identity and any user creation via OAuth.

## [2.129.0](https://github.com/open-horizon/exchange-api/pull/779) - 2025-06-20
- Issue 778: Added a second attempt authentication mechanism that forces a cache synchronization with the database.
             This is only useful when using multiple Exchange instances in a container orchestration cluster.
             Cache invalidation already works as intended for a single instance.   

## [2.128.1](https://github.com/open-horizon/exchange-api/pull/777) - 2025-06-18
- Issue 776: Fixed log level of basic response information.

## [2.128.0](https://github.com/open-horizon/exchange-api/pull/774) - 2025-06-12
- Add support for internal API key management and authentication.
- Create APIKEY table and handle schema migration.
- Add object model and service methods for API key operations.

## [2.127.0](https://github.com/open-horizon/exchange-api/pull/773) - 2025-06-03
- Guava has been replaced by Caffeine as the backend cache implementation. ScalaCache is still the wrapper.
  - There are other Caffeine implementations and wrappers out there. This is a start.
  - The logger can track the individual cache hits and misses per key. Presently disabled in the logger config.
    - Added appropriate config endpoints to the configuration file, as well as, environmental variable.
- The following 15 individual caches have been removed and/or consolidated:
  - usersAdmin
  - usersHubAdmin
  - nodesOwner
  - agbotsOwner
  - servicesOwner
  - patternsOwner
  - businessOwner
  - servicesOwner
  - managementPolicyOwner
  - patternsPublic
  - servicesPublic
  - businessPublic
  - managementPolicyPublic
  - ids
  - The IbmCloudAuth cache still exists, but it and its module are currently disabled.
- Two new caches have been created:
  - cacheResourceIdentity - Used for Authentication and requesting resource identity.
  - cacheResoourceOwnership - Used for Authorization and the requested resource identity.
  - These new caches still use the old configuration values. These will very likely need to be re-balanced in scale testing.
- Authentication, Authorization and Identity are now much more their own independent concepts.
  - Each is more individually extensible and testable. More work in IEAM v5.1+
  - This release is focused more on Authentication, and a moderate amount on Identity. Authorization changes are to enable the former at this stage.
- User Resource Identity is now based on UUIDs, not formatted strings.
  - This will also come to Agreement Bots and Nodes in the  Future. (Unified Identity)
  - Possibly other system resources as well (policies, patterns, groups, services, etc). work for another day...
- Database modelling changes:
  - Table for Users has been rebuilt.
  - All downstream `owner` fields are now type UUID. Foreign keys remade.
  - All client data is migrated with these schema changes.
- Added missing database indexes on all foreign keys.
- Added a few missing foreign keys to the database.
- Red Hat UBI 10 support added.
- JDK21 support added.
- Most Get or Get all resource routes have been rebuilt.
- All User routes have been rebuilt.
- Rebuilt and consolidated the Catalog routes.
- Hashpw routes have been removed from the Exchange.
- Deprecated BCrypt support for credential hashing. Replaced with Argon2id.
  - Configurable through the config file, or the appropriate environment variable.
  - The Exchange will auto-magically*TM convert all hashes for all resources on authentication.
- Updated GitHub workflows to use JDK 21.

### External changes
- change node search to service
- change node, node agreement, pattern search
- changed pattern to support service
### Limitations in This Version
- Agbot agreement resources still refer to workloadOrgid, workloadPattern, workloadUrl (but you can put service info in those fields, because they are not checked)
- Node status resources still refer to workloads and microservices (but i think you can put service info in those fields, because i don't think they are checked)

## [1.46.0](https://github.com/open-horizon/exchange-api/pull/56) - 2018-02-15
### External changes
- added keys to ms, wk, service, pattern (anax issue 498)
- Figured out how to set the Response codes in swagger
- Fixed the swagger 2 level resource problem

## [1.45.0](https://github.com/open-horizon/exchange-api/pull/55) - 2018-02-08
### External changes

## [1.41.0](https://github.com/open-horizon/exchange-api/pull/48) - 2017-10-25
### External changes
- When creating/updating a workload and verifying the existence of the apiSpecs, it now treats the MS versions as ranges
- (No need to upgrade the db if coming from version 1.38 or later, altho it won't hurt either)
### Todos left to be finished in subsequent versions
- If maxAgreements>1, for CS, in search don't return node to agbot if agbot from same org already has agreement for same workload.
- Add api for wiotp to get number of devices and agreements
- Allow random PW creation for user creation
- Add ability to change owner of node
- Add patch capability for node registered microservices?
- Add an unauthenticated admin status rest api
- Change local automated tests in Makefile to be more consistent with travis ci
- Figure out how to set "Response Class (Status 200)" in swagger
- See if there is a way to fix the swagger hack for 2 level resources
- Consider changing all creates to POST, and update (via put/patch) return codes to 200
- Any other schema changes?

- Added `"nodeHealth": { "missing_heartbeat_interval": 600, "check_agreement_status": 120 }` policy to patterns (it is a peer to the dataVerification field). Existing pattern resources in the DB will be converted on the way out. New POST/PUTs must include this new field.
- Added POST /orgs/{orgid}/patterns/{patid}/nodehealth and POST /orgs/{orgid}/search/nodehealth for agbot to get node lastHeartbeat and agreement status

(No need to upgrade the db if coming from version 1.38, altho it won't hurt either)

## [1.38.0](https://github.com/open-horizon/exchange-api/pull/43) - 2017-10-09
### External changes
- Added PUT/GET/DELETE /orgs/{id}/agbots/{id}/patterns/{id} and removed the patterns field from the agbot resource. This allows each org/pattern pair of an agbot to be managed individually.
- If you are coming from exchange versions 1.35 - 37, you can run POST /admin/upgradedb (which preserves the data). If coming from an earlier version, you must drop all of the tables and run POST /admin/initdb.

## [1.37.0](https://github.com/open-horizon/exchange-api/pull/42) - 2017-10-06
### External changes
- Added PUT/GET/DELETE /orgs/{id}/nodes/{id}/status
- If you are coming from v1.35.0 or v1.36.0, you can run POST /admin/upgradedb (which preserves the data). If coming from an earlier version, you must drop all of the tables and run POST /admin/initdb.

## [1.36.0](https://github.com/open-horizon/exchange-api/pull/40) - 2017-10-05
### External changes
- Allow queries in another org at the /microservices, /workloads, /patterns, /bctypes/{id}/blockchains level (and only return the public resources)
- Added 'public' as a filter attribute for microservices, workloads, patterns.
- Removed old/unused sections api.specRef, api.objStoreTmpls, and api.microservices from config.json
- Replaced empty {} return from PUT nodes/{nodeid} with normal {"code": 201, "msg": "node <id> added or updated"}
- Supported config.json api.limits.* equal to 0 to mean unlimited

## [1.35.0](https://github.com/open-horizon/exchange-api/pull/38) - 2017-09-27
- Fixed bug in which users, agbots, and nodes couldn't read their own org

## [1.34.0](https://github.com/open-horizon/exchange-api/pull/37) - 2017-09-27
### Limitations
- Need to dropdb and initdb, and re-enter data
### External changes
- Fixed bug: https://github.com/open-horizon/exchange-api/issues/35
- Enabled IBM agbots to read all patterns, search for nodes with patterns in other orgs, and msg nodes in other orgs (and they can msg it back)
- Enabled identities in other orgs to read all public patterns/workloads/microservices/blockchains
- Fix bug: Put root/root in the db, so foreign keys work correctly
- Now automatically create a public org and allow anonymous to create user in that org
- Ensured that a user can't elevate himself to an admin user
- Added schema table to store the current db schema and changed /admin/upgradedb to use that to upgrade correctly from any version. In this version of the exchange you still need to dropdb/initdb, but for all subsequent versions you should be able to use /admin/upgradedb.
- Quick fix to not require a slash in the node pattern attribute if it is blank


## [1.32.0](https://github.com/open-horizon/exchange-api/pull/36) - 2017-09-22
### Limitations
- Need to dropdb and initdb, and re-enter data
### External Incompatible changes
- Added pattern field to node resource
- Move arch field 1 level up in pattern schema, and renamed it to workloadArch
- Implemented /org/{orgid}/patterns/{pat-id}/search

## [1.31.0](https://github.com/open-horizon/exchange-api/pull/34) - 2017-09-20
### Limitations
- Need to dropdb and initdb, and re-enter data
### External Incompatible changes
- Removed the option on PUT users/{username} to set password or email to blank to mean don't update it. Implemented PATCH users/{username} instead.
- Changed config.json acls READ_MY_ORGS and WRITE_MY_ORGS to their singular versions
- Added 'admin' field to user, enabled admin users to do everything in their org (including create other users)
- Updated the pattern resource schema to more explicitly support multiple different workloads, and multiple versions of the same workload (see swagger)
- Added deployment_overrides and deployment_overrides_signature to patterns.workloads
- Added check_rate (int) in the dataVerification

## [1.29.0](https://github.com/open-horizon/exchange-api/pull/33) - 2017-09-19
### Limitations
- Need to dropdb and initdb, and re-enter data
- Cross-org access only works with root for now
- Before nodes, agbots, microservices, workloads, or patterns are created via front end auth, you have to create the user (and then use that person-type auth) so the owner foreign key succeeds
### External Incompatible changes
- Users, nodes, and agbots can now read their own org resource
- Renamed devices to nodes
- Removed properties, counterPartyProperties, microservices, maxAgreements from pattern resource
- Nodes can now read their own /org/{orgid} resource
- Moved bctype and blockchain under /org/{orgid} and added public field
- Modified PUT orgs/{org}/nodes/{id}/agreements/{agreementid} to include the pattern and workload, and to accept "microservices":[{"url":"ms url","org":"myorg"}] instead of an array of url strings like it is now.
- Modified PUT orgs/{org}/agbots/{id}/agreements/{agreementid} to accept workload orgid, pattern, and url, instead of just the url
- Added list of orgs/patterns to agbot resource
- A new setting `"frontEndHeader": "issuer"` is required in the `root` section of config.json to use data power in front of exchange
### Internal things done in this version
- Tested dropdb with older compose db
- Modified tests to have each suite use its own org
- Added support for data power headers

## [1.28.0](https://github.com/open-horizon/exchange-api/pull/32) - 2017-09-14
### Limitations
- Need to dropdb and initdb, and re-enter data
### External Incompatible changes
- All resource except /admin are now under /org/{orgid}. By convention we will use "IBM" for our orgid.
- All identities must be prefixed by "{orgid}/". E.g. IBM/myuser, IBM/mydeviceid, IBM/myagbotid (as a special case, the root user is root/root). This includes identities listed in owner and definedBy fields.
- Added 'public' field to microservices and workloads
- Change returned http code to 404 when there are no resource found for GET /org/{orgid}/users, /org/{orgid}/devices, /org/{orgid}/agbots
- Anonymous POST user/{username} (to create user) and POST user/{username}/reset are no longer supported (because we can't let them do that in any org)
- This rare case is no longer supported: no id is specified in the credentials and it defaults to the device/agbot id in the url
### Done in this version
- Added the /orgs/{orgid} resource
- Moved under /orgs/{orgid}: users, devices, agbots, microservices, workloads
- Updated ACL to only only access within your org (with a few exceptions)
- Added 'public' field to microservices and workloads
- Got automated tests to pass with pre-existing IBM org

## [1.27.0](https://github.com/open-horizon/exchange-api/pull/31) - 2017-09-08
- Added org resource (still need to implement ACLs for it and move other resources under it)
- Changed PUT /devices/{id}/agreements/{agid} to accept list of microservices (and corresponding GET and POST search changes)

## [1.26.0](https://github.com/open-horizon/exchange-api/pull/24) - 2017-07-08
- Fixed bug in which the CORS header Access-Control-Allow-Origin was not set in the response

## [1.25.0](https://github.com/open-horizon/exchange-api/pull/22) - 2017-06-20
- Added /microservices and /workloads resources
- Changed default permissions to allow devices and agbots to read all agbots
- Changed additional image tag from latest to volcanostaging

## [1.24.0](https://github.com/open-horizon/exchange-api/pull/13) - 2017-02-21
- Converted to the newer build.sbt file and upgraded to sbt version 0.13.13
- Migrated to version 9.4.x of jetty
- Made ACLs read from config.json (instead of hardcoded)
- Fixed bug: with a brand new db, could not run POST /admin/initdb because root user was not defined.
- Switched the dockerfile FROM statement to the official jetty image
- Added msgs, bctypes, and blockchains to the scale test script
- Removed requirement for MS numAgreements be set to 1.

## [1.23.0](https://github.com/open-horizon/exchange-api/pull/9) - 2017-02-13
- Added PUT/GET/DELETE /bctypes/{type} and PUT/GET/DELETE /bctypes/{type}/blockchains/{name} to store/retrieve BC info
- All DELETE methods not return 404 if the resource was not found. (Before it was inconsistent, some returned 204 and some 404.)
- Refactored authentication and authorization code, so now it is easier to read, easier to extend, and handles a few corner cases better. No external changes for all the mainline use cases.
- Changed the scala version used in building the container to be the latest stable and the same as my dev environment (2.12.1)
- Moved up to latest stable version of scalatra (2.4.1 ot 2.5.1)
- Access denied msgs now give details
- Fixed pw reset email to give link to the swagger entry to change your pw with the token

## [1.22.0](https://github.com/open-horizon/exchange-api/pull/2) - 2017-02-01
- Added DELETE /devices/{id}/agreements and DELETE /agbots/{id}/agreements to delete all of the agreements of a device/agbot
- Added GET /(devices|agbots)/{id}?attribute={attrname} to get a single attribute of the device/agbot resource
- Added PATCH /(devices|agbots)/{id} to set a single attribute of the device/agbot resource
- Modified PUT /devices/{id} and PUT /agbots/{id} to also take publicKey in the input body (but made it backward compatible so you do not have to specify it)
- Added POST devices/{device-id}/msgs (to send/create a msg), GET devices/{device-id}/msgs (to read your msgs), and DELETE devices/{device-id}/msgs/{msg-id}. Also added the same methods for agbots.
- Fixed POST /admin/dropdb to not delete the root user from the authentication cache, so you have credentials to run POST /admin/initdb
- Improved the implementation of POST /search/devices. All externals are the same, except now if all devices are stale it returns 404 (the json returned is still `{"devices":[],"lastIndex":0}`)
- Added GET /admin/status to use for monitoring the exchange api svr
- Added checks so users can not create more devices, agbots, agreements, or msgs than the max numbers allowed in config.json, and added the associated maxMessagesInMailbox in the default config.json
- Removed all code for the in-memory db (it was not being maintained anyway)
- Added logging a real client IP (gotten from haproxy)

## [1.21.0](https://github.com/open-horizon/exchange-api/pull/1) - 2017-01-12
- adjusted debug logging to be more helpful and less verbose
- fixed POST admin/migratedb

## 1.20.0
- added support for base64 encoded credentials in the header
- added optional filter params to GET /devices and /agbots
- now log who each rest api call is from
- root user is now saved in the persistent db (but still loaded/updated from config.json at startup)
- deleting a user will now delete all of its devices, agbots, and agreements (we now have a proper foreign key between users and devices/agbots, and we use the sql on delete cascade option, so now the db completely takes care of object referencial integrity)

## 1.19.0
- added fallback for getting device/agbot owner from the db during authentication
- automated tests can now use environment variables to run against a different exchange svr
- split the create part of PUT /users/{u} to POST /users/{u} so it can be rate limited. (Except PUT can still be used to creates users as root.)
- fixed but that didn't let POST /users/{u}/reset be called with no creds
- fixed schema of users table to have username be the primary key

## 1.18.0
- Added support for putting token, but not id, in URL parms

## 1.17.0
- Fixed bug when user creds are passed into url parms
- Increased timeouts when comparing auth cache to db, and temporarily fall back to cached

## 1.16.0
- Added synchronization (locking) around the auth cache

## 1.15.0
- DB persistence complete. Remove `api.db.memoryDb` from your config.json to use (the default is to use it). Specifically in this update:
  - Fixed some of the /users routes in the persistence case
  - Modified the auth cache to verify with the db when running in persistence mode (still a few changes needed for agbots)
  - Added error handling to /users routes in persistence mode
  - Got UsersSuite tests working for persistence (the device and agbot calls within there are still skipped in persistence mode)
  - Added persistence for all /devices routes, including transactions where needed
  - Added persistence for all /agbots routes, including transactions where needed
- Added POST /agreements/confirm
- Added config.json flag to disable getting microservices templates (because that part is a little slow). In this case, PUT /devices/{id} just returns an empty map `{}`
- DELETE /devices/{id} and /agbots/{id} now delete their agreements too

## 1.14.0
- Changed field daysStale to secondsStale in POST /search/devices. **This is not a backward compatible change.**
- Caught json parsing exceptions so they don't directly get returned to the client.
- Finished db persistence for GET /devices and /devices/{id}

## 1.13.0
- Added POST /agbots/{agid}/dataheartbeat and POST /agbots/{agid}/isrecentdata (experimental)
- Added POST /admin/initdb and /admin/dropdb to create the db schema. Still experimenting about whether we want these.
- Added POST /admin/loglevel to change the logging level on the fly
- Fixed bug: users and id's were not getting removed from the auth cache when they were deleted from the db.
- Fixed bug: an agreement for 1 MS of a device prevented the other MS from being returned in POST /search/devices
- Must for now set `db.memoryDb: true` in config.json file, like this:

```
{
  "api": {
    "db": {
      "memoryDb": true
    }
  }
}
```

## 1.12.0
- Fixed poor error msg when root email in config.json is blank
- Added in-memory cache of non-hashed pw/tokens. Increased speed by more than 10x.
- (No external changes in this version AFAIK)

## 1.11.0
- added scale/performance tests
- added a softwareVersions section of input to PUT /devices/{id} so devices can report their sw levels to the exchange. See swagger for details.
- POST /users/{username}/reset is now implemented and will email a timed pw reset token to the user's email address
- Made the logging level configurable via the config.json file

## 1.10.0
- Now it hashes all of the passwords and tokens before storing them in the db
- Add 2 /admin routes that can only be run as root: reload (reload the config file) and hashpw (return a hash the given pw)
- Added support for the root pw in the config file to be a hashed value
- To run the automated tests you must now create a local config file with the root pw in it (see above)
- Straightened out some of the Makefile variables and dependencies

## 1.9.0
- Added support for using an osgi version range in POST /search/devices
- Made GET / return html that lists available exchange services (so far just a link to the api swagger info)
- Fixed bug where PUT /devices/{id} created the device in the db even if the microservice url was wrong such that micro templates could not be returned
- Made the microservice url input to PUT /devices/{id} tolerant of a trailing /
- Added support for /etc/horizon/exchange/config.json. If that config file doesn't exist, the server will still run with default values appropriate for local development.
- Updated all of the bash test scripts to use a real microservice url.

## 1.8.0
- PUT /devices/{id} now returns a hash with keys of specRef and values of microservice template json blob

## 1.7.0
- Fixed bug: agbot couldn't run POST /search/devices
- Fixed a few other, more minor, access problems
- Updated swagger info to clarify who can run what

## 1.6.0
